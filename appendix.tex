\label{sec:list-of-policies}

All policies are listed at \url{https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/data}.

Main policy: \url{https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/data/data-code-policy}

Supplemental policies:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textit{ Policy for Papers Conducting Experiments and Collecting Primary Data} (\href{https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/data/policy-experimental}{aeaweb.org/journals/data/policy-experimental}) applies to laboratory experiments, field experiments, and any surveys, and specifies what should be provided in addition to the main policy.
    \item The \textit{Policy and Protocol for Third-Party Verifications} (\href{https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/data/policy-third-party}{aeaweb.org/journals/data/policy-third-party} specifies how we send out or accept verifications conducted by parties other than the Data Editor team.
    \item The \textit{Policy on Revisions of Data and Code Deposits in the AEA Data and Code Repository} (\href{https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/data/policy-revisions}{aeaweb.org/journals/data/policy-revisions}) applies when it becomes necessary to revise published replication packages. This may happen when readers and researchers contact the Data Editor, when authors identify a problem, correction, or improvement themselves, or when it becomes necessary for whatever reason to modify the replication package. The policy also defines under what conditions the version of record is modified, or whether the updated deposit simply becomes connected to, but does not replace the version of record.
